all we’ve been holding sessions twice weekly in Explorations group mainly focused on Alo Platform. We’re about to hold the 30th session this Saturday.

Even though so far the sessions were mostly on Alo Platform, particularly concepts that are prerequisites of Alo Runtime, we will be now holding quite a few sessions on concepts that are quite generic and nothing much specific to Alo, even though those are prerequisites for Alo Framework.

Tomorrow and Saturday 3 pm, we are starting a fresh (second) iteration on Object-Oriented Paradigm, a part of a series on Programming Paradigms. This series and next few series will cover some of the top-most widespread misconceptions in the industry on OOP, Functional Programming, OOP Principles like SOLID Principles, Microservices, etc. which are all part of CoLeap outline too. In Explorations group, we are basically fast-tracking some of the CoLeap concepts that are minimum prerequisites to understand Alo Framework.

Starting tomorrow’s session, we will cover the following programming concepts with a focus on how they relate to OOP and how these concept got evolved, mixed up and ultimately misunderstood:

Programs

Procedures

Structured Programming

Subprograms

Modularization

Standard Libraries and Frameworks

Types

Composite Types

Data Structures

Record Class
